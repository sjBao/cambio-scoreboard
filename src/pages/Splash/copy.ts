            2×2 pattern and leave the deck in the middle. 

            Each player is given one chance to check out the 2 cards closest to them and 
            memorize them. After that you may not peek again unless you pull a 7 or 8. 
            You may only play the game with one hand.

            The game starts by the first player to the right of 
            the dealer picking a card from the deck. 
            You may swap the card you pull with one of your own. 
            This would be in order to reduce the amount of points you have.`

Only one player may stick per card (so be quick!) but any player may stick a card even if it’s not their turn.
            If a player knows another player’s card and is quick enough to stick that card, the player who stuck it can give one of their own cards to the other player. If you stick a card and are wrong about that card, you have to keep the card in addition to receiving a penalty card. If you attempt to stick another player’s card and it’s wrong, they keep the card and you still receive the penalty card.`

If there is a tie, the player who didn’t call Cambio wins. If there is a tie between two players who didn’t call Cambio, the player with the least value cards wins. (i.e. Joker, Ace and Red King, 2 = Joker, Ace would win)`
